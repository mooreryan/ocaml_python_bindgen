# OCaml-Python Bindings Generator

[![Build and test](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen?branch=main)

Generate Python bindings with [pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml) directly from OCaml value specifications.

While you *could* write all your Python bindings by hand, it can be tedious and it gets old real quick.  While `pyml_bindgen` can't yet auto-generate all the bindings you may need, it can definitely take care of a lot of the tedious and repetitive work you need to do when writing bindings for a big Python library!! ðŸ’–

## Quick start

First, install `pyml_bindgen`.  It is available on [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/pyml_bindgen/).

```
$ opam install pyml_bindgen
```

Say you have a Python class you want to bind and use in OCaml.  (Filename: `adder.py`)

```python
class Adder:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
```

To do so, you write OCaml value specifications for the class and methods you want to bind.  (Filename: `val_specs.txt`)

```ocaml
val add : x:int -> y:int -> unit -> int
```

Then, you run `pyml_bindgen`.

```
$ pyml_bindgen val_specs.txt adder Adder --caml-module Adder > lib.ml
```

Now you can use your generated functions in your OCaml code.  (Filename: `run.ml`)

```ocaml
open Lib

let () = Py.initialize ()

let result = Adder.add ~x:1 ~y:2 ()

let () = assert (result = 3)
```

Finally, set up a dune file and run it.

```
(executable
 (name run)
 (libraries pyml))
```

```
$ dune exec ./run.exe
```

## Documentation

For information on installing and using `pyml_bindgen`, check out the [docs](https://mooreryan.github.io/ocaml_python_bindgen/).

Additionally, you can find examples in the [examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples) directory.  One neat thing about these examples is that you can see how to write Dune [rules](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#rule) to automatically generate your `pyml` bindings.
