# OCaml-Python Bindings Generator

[![Build and test](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen?branch=main)

Generate Python bindings with [pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml) directly from OCaml value specifications.

While you *could* write all your Python bindings by hand, it can be tedious and it gets old real quick.  While `pyml_bindgen` can't yet auto-generate all the bindings you may need, it can definitely take care of a lot of the tedious and repetitive work you need to do when writing bindings for a big Python library!! ðŸ’–
