# Automatically Generating Bindings

Sometimes it can be a bit of a pain to always have to run `pyml_bindgen` by hand.

One way to avoid this is by adding a [rule](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#rule) to your Dune file.

For an example of this, check out the `dune` file in the [quick start](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples/quick_start) example on GitHub.  It has lots of comments to show you how it is working.
