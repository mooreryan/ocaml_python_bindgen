# Rules Overview

The following pages are an informal description of some of the rules you have to follow when using `pyml_bindgen`.

I will try and keep them updated and (reasonably) complete.  However, if you really want to know how something is working, you may want to have a look at the [tests](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/test) or the [examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples).
