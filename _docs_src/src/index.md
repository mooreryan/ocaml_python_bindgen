Generate Python bindings with [pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml) directly from OCaml value specifications.

While you *could* write all your Python bindings by hand, it can be tedious and it gets old real quick.  While `pyml_bindgen` can't yet auto-generate all the bindings you may need, it can definitely take care of a lot of the tedious and repetitive work you need to do when writing bindings for a big Python library!! ðŸ’–

## How to get started

Getting started with a new package or library and going through lots of docs can be frustrating.  Here's the order I would suggest you look at these docs

* Read the installing and quick start sections of this page.
* Then read through the [getting started](getting-started.md) tutorial.  If you only read one page in the docs, make it this one!  It explains most of what you need to know to get started with a simple example, while not getting bogged down in too much details.
* Next, you can either peruse the [rules](todo.md) for writing value specifications that `pyml_bindgen` can understand, or check out [more examples](todo.md).

If you have any questions or issues, please [let me know](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/issues) about it on GitHub!

## Installing

`pyml_bindgen` is a [Dune](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project, so you *should* be able to clone the repository and build it with `dune` as long as you have the proper dependencies installed ðŸ¤ž

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mooreryan/pyml_bindgen.git
$ cd pyml_bindgen
$ opam install . --deps-only --with-doc --with-test
$ dune test && dune build --profile=release && dune install
$ pyml_bindgen --help
... help screen should show up ...
```

## Quick start

`pyml_bindgen` is a CLI program that generates OCaml modules that bind Python classes via [pyml](TODO).

Here's a small example.  Take a Python class, `Thing`.  (Put it in a file called `thing.py`...this means the Python module will be called `thing`.)

```python
class Thing:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def add(self, y):
        return self.x + y
```

Now, look at your Python class and decide how you would like to use this class on the OCaml side.

For now, we will just do a direct translation, keeping in mind the [rules](TODO) for writing value specs that `pyml_bindgen` can process.  Maybe something like this.  (Put it in a file called `val_specs.txt`.)

```ocaml
val __init__ : x:int -> unit -> t

val x : t -> int

val add : t -> y:int -> unit -> int
```

Finally, to generate the OCaml code, run the `pyml_bindgen` program.  There are a couple of options you can choose, but let's just keep it simple for now.

```
$ pyml_bindgen val_specs.txt thing Thing --caml-module=Thing > lib.ml
$ ocamlformat --enable-outside-detected-project lib.ml
```

And here's the output of the `ocamlformat` command.

```ocaml
let filter_opt l = List.filter_map Fun.id l

let import_module () = Py.Import.import_module "thing"

module Thing : sig
  type t

  val of_pyobject : Pytypes.pyobject -> t option

  val to_pyobject : t -> Pytypes.pyobject

  val __init__ : x:int -> unit -> t

  val x : t -> int

  val add : t -> y:int -> unit -> int
end = struct
  type t = Pytypes.pyobject

  let is_instance pyo =
    let py_class = Py.Module.get (import_module ()) "Thing" in
    Py.Object.is_instance pyo py_class

  let of_pyobject pyo = if is_instance pyo then Some pyo else None

  let to_pyobject x = x

  let __init__ ~x () =
    let callable = Py.Module.get (import_module ()) "Thing" in
    let kwargs = filter_opt [ Some ("x", Py.Int.of_int x) ] in
    of_pyobject @@ Py.Callable.to_function_with_keywords callable [||] kwargs

  let x t = Py.Int.to_int @@ Py.Object.find_attr_string t "x"

  let add t ~y () =
    let callable = Py.Object.find_attr_string t "add" in
    let kwargs = filter_opt [ Some ("y", Py.Int.of_int y) ] in
    Py.Int.to_int @@ Py.Callable.to_function_with_keywords callable [||] kwargs
end
```

Check out the [examples](TODO) for more info about using and running `pyml_bindgen`.  Then, check out the [rules](TODO) that you have to follow when writing value specifications that `pyml_bindgen` can read.
