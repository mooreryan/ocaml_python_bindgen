Generate Python bindings with [pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml) directly from OCaml value specifications.

While you _could_ write all your Python bindings by hand, it can be tedious and it gets old real quick. While `pyml_bindgen` can't yet auto-generate all the bindings you may need, it can definitely take care of a lot of the tedious and repetitive work you need to do when writing bindings for a big Python library!! ðŸ’–

## How to get started

Getting started with a new package or library and going through lots of docs can be frustrating. Here's the order I would suggest you look at these docs

- Read the installing and quick start sections of this page.
- Then read through the [getting started](getting-started.md) tutorial. If you only read one page in the docs, make it this one! It explains most of what you need to know to get started with a simple example, while not getting bogged down in too much details.
- Next, check out some working [examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples) on GitHub.
- Finally, there are some more (potentially) important details in the Rules and Miscellaneous sections of this site.

If you have any questions or issues, please [let me know](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/issues) about it on GitHub!

_Note: I try to keep this doc updated, but it may sometimes get out-of-sync with the latest `pyml_bindgen`. For the most up-to-date info, see the [examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples), [tests](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/test), and [dev tests](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/test_dev), which are tested and kept up-to-date under CI._

## Installing

### Using Opam

`pyml_bindgen` is available on [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/pyml_bindgen/). You can install it in the normal way:

```bash
$ opam install pyml_bindgen
```

### Installing from sources

If you want to install from sources, e.g., to track the main branch or a development branch, but you do not want to install all the test and development packages, clone the repository, checkout the branch you want to follow and run opam install manually:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen.git
$ git checkout dev
$ opam install .
```

This will save a lot of install time as it avoids some heavy packages.

### Development

If instead, you want to work on `pyml_bindgen` development, will need to ensure you have the test dependencies, as well as a couple dependencies that are not included in the `opam` file (`core`, `core_bench`, and `bisect_ppx`.)

E.g.,

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen.git
$ opam install . --deps-only --with-doc --with-test
$ opam install core core_bench core_unix bisect_ppx
$ dune build
```

## Quick start

_Note: You can find full examples in the [examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples) directory on GitHub. One neat thing about the examples there is that you can see how to write Dune [rules](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#rule) to automatically generate your `pyml` bindings._

`pyml_bindgen` is a CLI program that generates OCaml modules that bind Python classes via [pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml).

Here's a small example. Take a Python class, `Thing`. (Put it in a file called `thing.py`...this means the Python module will be called `thing`.)

```python
class Thing:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def add(self, y):
        return self.x + y
```

Now, look at your Python class and decide how you would like to use this class on the OCaml side.

For now, we will just do a direct translation, keeping in mind the rules for writing value specs that `pyml_bindgen` can process. Maybe something like this. (Put it in a file called `val_specs.txt`.)

```ocaml
val __init__ : x:int -> unit -> t

val x : t -> int

val add : t -> y:int -> unit -> int
```

Finally, to generate the OCaml code, run the `pyml_bindgen` program. There are a couple of options you can choose, but let's just keep it simple for now.

```bash
$ pyml_bindgen val_specs.txt thing Thing --caml-module=Thing > lib.ml
```

If you want nicer formatting than that which is generated by `pyml_bindgen`, you can use `ocamlformat`.

```bash
$ ocamlformat --enable-outside-detected-project lib.ml
```
