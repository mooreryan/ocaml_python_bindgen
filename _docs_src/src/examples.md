# Lots of Examples

You can find a lot of examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples).

These examples are particularly cool because they show you how to use Dune [rules](TODO) to generate bindings automatically.  Also, they are tested along with the rest of the `pyml_bindgen` code, so they are guaranteed to be up-to-date and working.
