# Embedding Python Source Code

This example is pretty similar to the [quick start](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples/quick_start) example.

This one shows you how to embed the Python code directly into the generated OCaml module. It will then be evaluated at run time.

To do this, you can use the `--embed-python-source` option. See this library's `dune` file for how to set it up.
