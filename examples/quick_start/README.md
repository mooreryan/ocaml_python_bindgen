# Quick Start

This is a simple example where all files including the Python module that we want to bind are in a single directory.

For more details about this example, see the [Quick Start](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen#quick-start).  There you will see an explanation of how to run `pyml_bindgen` to generate the bindings you see here.

## Files

* `adder.py`: the `Adder` class that we want to bind
* `val_specs.txt`: the OCaml value specifications that define the binding functions
* `lib.ml`: library file generated by running `pyml_bindgen`
* `run.ml`: a runner script for driving the example
* `dune`: the dune file which includes a `rule` for auto-generating the `lib.ml` file

## Generating `lib.ml`

`lib.ml` is the file of `pyml` bindings generated by `pyml_bindgen`.

The `dune` file has a rule to automatically generate this file for you when you run `dune build` in the root of the repository.  Check out the `dune` file to see how to do this...it has lots of comments in there!

However, if you wanted to make this file manually, you could do so like this:

```
$ pyml_bindgen val_specs.txt adder Adder --caml-module Adder | \
     ocamlformat --name lib.ml -
```
